Submit homework here

Check out [the slack post](https://westviewrobotics.slack.com/messages/computer_vision) for a bit more information to help on this homework.

For your homework this week, 

1.) Download image of Japanese flag from http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9e/Flag_of_Japan.svg/320px-Flag_of_Japan.svg.png

Remember: ```wget <url>```

2.) Write a program to do the following:
-Load image into Mat
-Convert image to HSV color space
-Threshold the hue to isolate the sun in the flag. Do this by trying several sets of values between 0 and 255 to find the values
-Run the Canny edge detector
-Find contours
-Draw contours
This should have drawn a circle around the sun in the flag

3.) As always, submit your hw as a pull request. (Make sure you clone from THIS ONE :D)
