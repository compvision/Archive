# 2.3.1 Class Implementation
### Lab Guidelines
Split the complete CV code into a multi-class program.

Create a separate class for Main, Target, Target Detector, and Target Processor.
Each class must have the methods that are unique to its function.
E.g. TargetDetector will have a findContours method that can be called from Main.
